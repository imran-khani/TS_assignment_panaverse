// Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// Solution:
const myFriends2: string[]= ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"];
console.log(`Hello, ${myFriends2[0]}!`);
console.log(`Hello, ${myFriends2[1]}!`);
console.log(`Hello, ${myFriends2[2]}!`);
console.log(`Hello, ${myFriends2[3]}!`);
